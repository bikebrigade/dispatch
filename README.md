# BikeBrigade

**[ðŸŽ¬ Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/bikebrigade/projects/14/)**

## Prerequisities
1.  [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) with [flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
1.  [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Getting an environment set up
1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the env file `cp .env.local.sample .env.local`
3. Run `nix develop` inside the directory. This will create an environment that has all the dependencies installed locally. If you don't have flakes enabled, there's a backwards-compatible `nix-shell` as well.
4. Inside the nix shell, run `docker-compose up -d`
5. Setup everything, run `mix bb.init`

## Development environment
You'll want to be inside the `nix-shell` when working on this project. Make sure postgres is running with `docker-compose up -d`

As you develop, when you've downloaded new code, you can run `mix setup` to update the dependencies and run any migrations.

To start the server & console run:

```
scripts/server
```

Note: if you want the Elixir language server to be accessible to your editor, you will have to launch your editor from within the `nix-shell`, or do some [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/) or [lorri](https://github.com/target/lorri) magic.

### Testing

You can run the entire test suite with

```
scripts/test
```

If you wish to run a specific test you can provide a file and optionally a line number

```
scripts/test path/to/test.exs:LINENUMBER
```

### Updating nix dependencies
[niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv) is used to ensure everyone is using the same version of nixpkgs.
To update the nixpkgs version run:

```
nix-shell -p niv
niv update
```

You can then commit the changes.

## Deploying

### Staging

Force push to the staging branch in order to deploy to staging

```
scripts/deploy_staging
```

### Production

Pushes to the `main` branch (including merged PRs) automatically trigger a production deploy. Please **be aware of this when pushing small changes without a PR.**
